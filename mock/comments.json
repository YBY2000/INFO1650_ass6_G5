The ferry ride to Liberty Island was enjoyable, and the views of the New York City skyline were breathtaking. Exploring the museum inside the pedestal provided valuable insights into the statue's history. Climbing to the crown was a bit strenuous, but the panoramic views from up there were worth it. It's a must-visit attraction for anyone in New York."
